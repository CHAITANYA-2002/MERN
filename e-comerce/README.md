## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)
- Git
- A Cloudinary account for image storage
- Stripe or PayPal account for payment integration

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CHAITANYA-2002/MERN.git
   cd MERN/e-comerce
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - For the backend:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm install
     ```
   - For the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following:
     ```
     PORT=5000
     MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
     CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
     PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add:
     ```
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Start the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm start
     ```
   - The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and `http://localhost:5000` (backend).

### Notes on the README
- This README assumes the project includes common e-commerce features like user authentication, product management, and payment integration, which are standard in MERN stack e-commerce projects (as seen in similar GitHub repositories like mohamedsamara/mern-ecommerce and shiivaniiawasthii/MERN-Ecommerce).
- If the project has specific features or configurations (e.g., deployment on Vercel, use of a specific payment gateway, or additional APIs), you can update the README accordingly.
- Screenshots are suggested but not included since I cannot generate or view the actual app. You can add them by running the app locally and capturing images.
